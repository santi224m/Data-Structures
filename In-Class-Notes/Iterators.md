# Iterators

* An iterator is a class that helps us traverse a linked list
* If we use iterators in our code, then we could change from one data structure to a different data structure and our code would still work as long as the new data structure also works with iterators
* In order for a class to be considered a container, it must have a ```begin()``` method and an ```end()``` method. It also has to be able to return its own iterator
* You can use iterators as indexes in linked lists
