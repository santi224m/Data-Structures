# Chapter 3 - Linked Lists

* A Linked List is a pointer-base data structure. The are made up of nodes that contain the list items
* With a linked list, we lose the ability to access an element using the ```get(i)``` and ```set(i,x)``` operations in constant time that we have in an array based list
* To access an element, we have to traverse the whole list until we get to the element that we want
* The advatage of Linked Lists is that they are more dynamic
  * Elements can be removed or added in constant time
